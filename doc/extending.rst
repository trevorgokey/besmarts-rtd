Extending
=========

Thank you for your interest in BESMARTS and wanting to extend its capabilities. We hope that you find it easy to add functionality, and that the existing codebase is extensive and flexible enough to suite your needs. If you feel your work can be useful to others, we would be happy to include it here!

Below is some descriptions are possible places to extend functionality.
